    <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 1</h1>
    <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What is meant by first class functions?</h2>
   
    A function can be passed as a value/arguments into another functions or can be returned into another functions.
    This dual capability of the function makes them call as a first class function.
    Also called as first class citizens.

    <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 2</h1>
    <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h2>
    call bind and apply  they are used for function borrowing.
    <br>
    call method is used to avoid the redundancy of calling the function again and again.
    <br>
    the main difference between call and apply is that in call we pass arguments by comma separated but in apply we pass arguments in the form of an array.
    <br>
    whereas bind method creates the connection with the function it calls the entire function we assign it to a variable and then call that variable in bind method.

    <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 3</h1>
    <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What are objects in javascript?</h2>
    A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method).
    Properties are behaviour aspects related to objects.
    <br>
    Methods are action which are performed are called methods.
    we have differnet methods to create an object:-
    1.Normal Method
    2.Object Constructor
    <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 4</h1>
    <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What are function constructors?</h2>

    In JavaScript, a constructor function is used to create objects.
   
In the above example, function Person() is an object constructor function.
<h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 5</h1>
<h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">Explain prototypes</h2>
What is prototype in JavaScript with example?
In JavaScript, every function and object has a property named prototype by default.
<br>
 For example, 
 <br>
 function Person () { 
    <br>
    this.name = 'John', this. age = 23 
<br>
} 
<br>
const person = new Person(); 
<br>
// checking the prototype value console.

<h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 6</h1>
<h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What is prototype chain ?</h2>


The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript,
<br>
 where function's prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property is not visible.
 <br>
  Every function includes prototype object by default. 

  <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 7</h1>
  <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">Give an example of inheritance using function constructor ?</h2>



  <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 8</h1>
  <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What are callbacks?</h2>
Callback functions are those functions that are called after certain period of time.or that can be passed as a value. which can be called back wehn required.
  A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, 
  <br>which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

  <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 9</h1>
  <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What are callbacks?</h2>
  A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The types of callback are:-
There are two types of callbacks, differing in how they control data flow at runtime: 
<br>

blocking callbacks (also known as synchronous callbacks or just callbacks)
<br>

 and deferred callbacks (also known as asynchronous callbacks).
 <br>
 <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 10</h1>
  <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What is the use of setTimeout</h2>
  setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.
  <br>
  We all have used alarms or reminders several times, this setTimeout() method also has the same purpose in web applications.
  <br> We use this to delay some kind of executions. It is also used for animations and DOM manipulations in jquery.
  <h1 style="background-color:burlywood">Question 11</h1>
  <h2 style="background-color:darksalmon">What is an event loop and call stack</h2>
  The call stack is a mechanism that helps the JavaScript interpreter to keep track of the functions that a script calls.

  Every time a script or function calls a function, it's added to the top of the call stack. Every time the function exits, the interpreter removes it from the call stack.
  The call stack is a LIFO queue (Last In, First Out). 
  <br>The event loop continuously checks the call stack to see if there's any function that needs to run. 
  <br>
  While doing so, it adds any function call it finds to the call stack and executes each one in order.
